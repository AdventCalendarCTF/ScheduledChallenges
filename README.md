# Scheduled challenges

For the advent calendar, a new challenge is enabled each day. The purpose of 
this plugin is to automate this task. 

One more state of the challenge is added, "schedule" and a date of activation
can be set.

With this state, the challence is seen disabled until the activation date and
enabled after.
